# 🌸 Thaaimadi – Honoring with Compassion

**Thaaimadi** is a compassionate initiative dedicated to honoring the departed with dignity and supporting families through the traditional Tamil final rites known as *Iruthi Sadangu*. This project blends cultural reverence with practical support, ensuring that no soul is forgotten — especially those without family.
